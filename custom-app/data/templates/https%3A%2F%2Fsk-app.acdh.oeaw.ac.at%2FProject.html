		<h2>The SemanticKraus Project</h2>
    <h3 class="page-section__title">Connecting Kraus-Scholarship to the Semantic Web</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
      The SemanticKraus project provides a reference resource containing research data from several projects on the writer, satirist, and cultural critic Karl Kraus (1874–1936). The project compiles and transforms biographical and bibliographical index data to create a comprehensive network of people, texts, and their interrelations. In detail, the data contains
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>biographical data, including birth, death, occupation, party affiliation</li>
        <li>bibliographical data: published texts (literary, journalistic or other)</li>
        <li>legal files (i. e. bibliographical data) and legal cases (i.e. event data)</li>
        <li>text passages and mentions resp. intertextual references on texts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
The source projects the data is derived from are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://fackel.oeaw.ac.at"><i>Die Fackel online</i></a>, a complete digital edition of the influential periodical Kraus edited from 1899 to 1936.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.kraus.wienbibliothek.at"><i>Karl Kraus Rechtsakten</i></a>, a digital edition of Kraus’s legal files from the estate of his long-time lawyer Oskar Samek.</li>
        <li>A digital edition of <i><a href="https://kraus1933.ace.oeaw.ac.at/index.html">Dritte Walpurgisnacht</a></i>, Kraus’s stance in the face of the National Socialist takeover in 1933, unpublished during Kraus’s lifetime.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
All of these projects – which are in one way or another linked to the ACDH-CH – have amassed substantial amounts of index data. <i>Die Fackel online</i>, for example, includes an index of persons mentioned within the more than 22,000 pages of <i>Die Fackel</i>, amounting to a total of 16,900 names and 129,000 mentions. Kraus’s legal files are accompanied by indices containing the data of 1,700 persons and 2,100 literary and non-literary works mentioned or cited in the legal files (which by themselves amount to about 4,000 documents). The index of <i>Dritte Walpurgisnacht</i> – notably a single, voluminous work – lists 400 people and 1,100 texts (the majority of which are newspaper articles) that are mentioned or quoted in 3,000 text passages.</p>
<p>All of this data, although overlapping to a high degree, had been mostly uncorrelated so far. It was transformed to RDF, ingested into a triple store and provided with a user interface based on ResearchSpace as well as a SPARQL endpoint. The result is both a research platform and a reference resource offering users the opportunity for manual exploration as well as automated data retrieval – thus ensuring the integration of Kraus research into the LOD Cloud and serving the frequently expressed demand for open, reusable, and interlinked edition data.</p>
  <p>The project is accompanied by a HowTo-Blog: <a href="https://howto.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/de/curriculum/semantickraus-a-blogpost-series">SemanticKraus - A Blogpost Series</a></p>
